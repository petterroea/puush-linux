S-ul uploader for linux
=====================

Originally written by Sunmock Yang as a puush uploader
Ported for s-ul by Liam Svan√•sbakken Crouch

Please note this README is from the original puush uploader, but all existing features are left untouched.

Takes screenshots and uploads them to s-ul using the s-ul API and copies the link to clipboard. Recommended for set up with keyboard shortcuts
<br>Utilises __gnome-screenshot__ for taking screenshots, __zenity__ for file uploads (both included in Ubuntu).

## Instructions
- Clone or download the repo
- In file "s-ul" add your s-ul API key to SUL_API_KEY
  - (You can find your API key at [https://s-ul.eu/settings.php](https://s-ul.eu/settings.php) )
- Make it executable using __chmod +x s-ul__
- Place this file wherever you want (recommended: /usr/local/bin)
- Set up keyboard shortcuts within linux
  - (in Ubuntu it's system settings > keyboard > keyboard shortcuts > custom shortcuts)
  - Log out for the changes to take place
  - Here's what it looks like for mine: ![S-Ul keyboard setup](http://puu.sh/cOyVz/8dcb1cd498.png)
